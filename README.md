# remote-js

This is a small tool to have a remote console to an existing browser.

When developing mobile web pages you usually miss the development console
provided by desktop browsers.

This command line tool allows you to add an script tag into your mobile webpage
that will connect back to the tool using WebSockets allowing you to run
javascript remotely in the mobile browser.

## Requirements

This is a node.js app, so you'll need to install node. That's all :)
